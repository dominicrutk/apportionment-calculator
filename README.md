# Apportionment Calculator

This command line calculator can apportion seats based on the Huntington-Hill method (the method used by the U.S. House).
It was inspired by [this calculator](https://isr.umich.edu/apportionment-calculator-for-us-census/) from the University
of Michigan, but it is designed to be more flexible by (a) not being restricted to U.S. states and (b) not being limited
to 999 seats.

## Usage

Currently, you must have Rust installed to run this tool (instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).
Hopefully, that will change in the future.

```bash
cargo run
```
